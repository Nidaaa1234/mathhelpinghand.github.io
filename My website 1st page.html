            <tr><td><p class="p"> Archimedes, also known as the “Father of Mathematics,” contributed a lot in the field of Mathematics. Not only Mathematics, he made many valuable inventions in the field of Physics as well. Apart from being a mathematician, he was also an astronomer and made many significant contributions in the field of astronomy. In the life span of 75 years, he introduced various laws and theories related to mathematics. Today, we all are able to measure area and volume of different shapes with the help of relevant laws, theorems, and formulae, but we don’t know from where all these laws and formulae came. Area and volume of different 3D and 2D shapes were given by Archimedes. We can not think of mathematics without him and his inventions. Many more inventions made by him are there that we still have to acknowledge. Let us briefly discuss his inventions one by one.  </p></td>

    <p><div class="invevted">What Is Maths</div></p>
    <p class="p">Mathematics simply means to learn or to study or gain knowledge. The theories and concepts given in mathematics help us understand and solve various types of problems in academic as well as in real life situations. Mathematics is a subject of logic. Learning mathematics will help students to grow their problem-solving and logical reasoning skills. Solving mathematical problems is one of the best brain exercises.</p>
    <h2 class="heading"><b>Basic Mathematics</b></h2>
<p class="p">The fundamentals of mathematics begin with arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. These are the basics that every student learns in their elementary school. Here is a brief of these operations.<br>
</p><br>
<ol style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; font-family: Times, serif ; padding-left: 40px;">
    <li>   Addition: Sum of numbers (Eg. 1 + 2 = 3)</li><br>
    <li>   Subtraction: Difference between two or more numbers (Eg. 5 – 4 = 1)</li><br>
    <li>   Multiplication: Product of two or more numbers (Eg. 3 x 9 = 27)</li><br>
    <li>   Division: Dividing a number into equal parts (Eg. 10 ÷ 2 = 5, 10 is divided in 2 equal parts)</li></ol><br>

<p><div class="invevted">Basic Math Rules</div></p>
<h2 class="heading" style="margin-right: 800px;"><b>BODMAS Rule Explanation</b></h2>
<table>
  <tbody>
      <tr><td><p class="p"> It explains the order of operations to be performed while solving an expression. According to the BODMAS rule, if an expression contains brackets ((), {}, []) we have first to solve or simplify the bracket followed by ‘order’ (that means powers and roots, etc.), then division, multiplication, addition and subtraction from left to right. Solving the problem in the wrong order will result in a wrong answer.
        <br><br>
        The BODMAS rule can be applied, if the expression involving more than one operator. In this case, first, we have to simplify the terms inside the bracket from the inner most bracket to the outermost bracket [{()}], and simplify the roots or exponents, if any. Then perform multiplication or division operation from left to right. Finally, perform addition or subtraction operation to get the accurate answer.
        <br><br>
        Note: The “O” in the BODMAS full form is also called “Order”, which refers to the numbers which involve powers, square roots, etc. Check the examples below to have a better understanding of using the BODMAS rule.</p></td>

<h2 class="heading" style="margin-right: 800px;"><b>BODMAS Rule Full Form</b></h2>
<p class="p">In Canada, this order of operation is also mentioned as BEDMAS(Brackets, exponents, division, multiplication, addition and subtraction). Though the order of operation has given different names in different countries, the meaning for all is the same. While applying the BODMAS rule we should follow the order of these operations.</p>

  <p class="p" style="text-align: left;"><b><u>EXAMPLE</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Calculate: 1/2[{-2(1+2)}10]</b><BR><BR>
  Step 1: Simplify the terms inside () followed by {}, then [].<BR>
  Step 2: Operate terms with the terms outside the bracket.<BR><BR>
  = 1/2 [{-2(3)} 10]<BR>
  = 1/2 [{-6} 10]<BR>
  = 1/2 [-60]<BR>

  <!--PEMDAS Section -->
  <h2 class="heading" style="margin-right: 800px;"><b>PEMDAS Rule Explanation</b></h2>
  <table>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td><p class="p" style="text-align: left;"> In Mathematics, we do operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. These operations are performed by a certain rule or say there is an order of operation. PEMDAS rule is one of the rules which is exactly equal to BODMAS rule. The full form of PEMDAS is given below:<br>
          <br><div class="p" style="margin-left: 10%;"><b>P - Parentheses  [{()}]<br>
          E - Exponents (Powers and Roots)<br>
          MD - Multiplication and Division (left to right) (x and ÷)<br>
          AS - Addition  and Subtraction (left to right) (+ and -)<br><br></b></div>
          <p class="p" style="text-align: left;" >whereas the full form of BODMAS is - Brackets Order Division Multiplication Addition and Subtraction.<br><br>
          PEMDAS term is used mainly in the US but in India and the UK, we call it as BODMAS. But there is no difference between them. The order of operations for brackets, orders, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division is the same for both the rule. The PEMDAS rule can be remembered using the acronym “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally”.<br><br>
          PEMDAS formula is nothing but the order of calculations by means of which we calculate difficult equations step by step.</p></td>

  <b>Calculate: [25 + {14 - (3 x 6)}]</b><br><br>
Solution:<br>
[25 + {14 - (3 x 6)}]<br><br>
As per PEMDAS, here we have perform the operations within the parentheses, first (), second {} and finally []<br><br>
=[25 + {14 - 18}]<br>
= [25 +{-4}]<br><br>
Here, we have to perform multiplication for the signs<br><br>
